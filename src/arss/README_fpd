FeedParser Database

The database in this module is maintained by a list of feed URLs,
when the database performs a function such as updating all its feeds it will
look at the URLs in the list of feeds to determain if a new feed has been
added or if one has been removed. If a new URL is added the database will
automatically build that feed from the URL and add it to the database,
but if a feed URL has been removed the database will remove its associated
Feed Object. Note that this module does not maintain a copy or list of feed
URLs which means a list will often need to be passed to the database
during update(etc..) calls.

For refences of how a list of feeds may be handled you can look at aRSS in 
the tehks-testing branch of AWN-EXTRAs

Goals: 
* Easy to use front end for feedparser and sqlalchemy
* Independent from UI components which caused this module to be built.

Issues: 
* No way to maintain a list of feeds with in this modules. This will not
  change


Bugs:
* Deleting a feed is less then optimal, 
  Might not delete fully from database
