This a clock applet from Avant-window-navigator.

Overview
========

To displays are possible:
 - digital : only digit and letter. It can show the time and the date. The format are configurable.
 - analogic : the time are display with cairo-clock themes. The date can also be displayed and the format is configurable too.
To configure the applet, go to gconf-editor, in /apps/avant-window-navigator/applets/, find the number corresponding to the clock
(it's easy, properties start with 'clock_' ;) )	and modify what you want
There is the reflection, with a small probleme a the bottom, but it works.
The resize works ONLY for the analogic clock.
